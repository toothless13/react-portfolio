        Hi, my name is Tim, and I&apos;m a Junior Software Developer.
        <br /><br/>
        I&apos;ve been learning and creating projects for just over a year, and created this website to show my recent projects, and the skills that I&apos;ve acquired.
        <br /><br />
        I&apos;m currently most familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node, and my next goal is to become familiar with and learn about React.
        <br /><br />
        This page will be updated as my range of skills increases and as and when I complete new projects.
        <br /><br />
        As well as coding, I also enjoy playing guitar, video games and watching Formula 1 & anime! I&apos;m also currently learning Japanese in my spare time.
